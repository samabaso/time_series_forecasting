Data Collection: We’re using yfinance to pull historical stock data. In this example, the stock ticker for Apple (AAPL) is used.

Data Visualization: A plot of the stock’s closing prices over time helps visualize the trend.

Time Series Decomposition: This helps to break down the time series into its main components:

Trend: The overall direction of the data.
Seasonality: Repeating short-term cycles.
Residual: What’s left after removing trend and seasonality.
ARIMA Model: We fit an ARIMA model to forecast future stock prices. The model parameters (p, d, q) can be fine-tuned for better accuracy.

Prediction: We forecast the stock prices for the test data and compare the predicted values with the actual values.

Evaluation: We use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of the model.
